Twilio integration for Ethicsware
=======================================

This lets you use your ethicsware project over text message, so you can text back and forth with a number!

This uses the Twilio API. 

(As a note, this API costs $. There is a free trial. 
It is relatively inexpensive - $1/month for a phone number, and $0.0047 to send and receive one text message. So if you send and receive 100 text messages/mo, it will cost $1.47/mo.)
