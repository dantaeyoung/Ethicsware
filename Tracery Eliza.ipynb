    "### Define Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the patterns / rules below. \n",
    "Almost everything can be changed by editing `tracery_rules` and `conversation_patterns`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example on how the `conversation_pattern` matching works\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "[[r'(.*) you (.*) me'],\n",
    "     [\"What makes you think I {1} you?\"]],  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take `r'(.*) you (.*) me'`! \n",
    "The `r'` at the start means that it's a 'regex', or a regular expression, which is a way to describe a pattern that you're looking for. \n",
    "`(.*)` is what's called a \"capturing group\". Really for this purpose, you can think of it as \"detecting and remembering any kind of text\".\n",
    "\n",
    "So.. if we have a text such as \"I feel like you really listen to me\", then the regex will match the template, and capture:\n",
    "\n",
    "`(I feel like) you (really listen to) me`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, in the next part of the pattern, you can see the outcome sentence `\"What makes you think I {1} you?\"`.\n",
    "The `{1}` means the 1th captured group. In most coding languages, numbers start with 0, so if we label the captured groups from our sentences above:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(I feel like) you (really listen to) me.\n",
    "    {0}                  {1}          \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "And if we place the `{1}` back into the outcome sentence, it will look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "**\"What makes you think I really listen to you?\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "What a realistic sounding sentence!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tracery\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we're also using tracery. This library is a simple and powerful library that lets us create natural sounding grammar. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we surround a phrase with `#`es, tracery will look in `tracery_rules` to see if there's a list of rules; if it finds a list, then it will randomly pick a word to insert.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for example, if the resulting outcome sentence is: \n",
    "\n",
    "`\"Do #computer#s worry you?\"`,\n",
    "\n",
    "In `tracery_rules`, \"computer\" converts into one of four possible outcomes: \"computer\", \"AI\", \"bot\", \"machine\". Tracery will thus randomly choose one of those four phrases, and insert them into the original sentence:\n",
    "\n",
    "`\"Do computers worry you?\"`\n",
    "`\"Do AIs worry you?\"`\n",
    "`\"Do bots worry you?\"`\n",
    "`\"Do machines worry you?\"`\n",
